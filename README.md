# Spanish Flashcards
#### Video Demo:  https://studio.youtube.com/video/svyoubYb7s8/edit
#### Description: An app for making vocabulary flashcards.

To use, set up a MySQL server and replace the password in `database/my_connect.py` with your own. (The password shown is
not sensitive - it is only used to edit the vocabulary words on my local machine that were shown in the video.)

There are two functionalities: Add cards and Review Cards.

You can choose which categories your cards go into, or choose to drop them into a general category. You are also able to add an example sentence in the language of the word, for extra context. All of this will be saved in the database.

When choosing the Review option, you can choose quick review - which will instantly give you 10 words to practice - or you can curate your own review by choosing how the words are chosen for you (by how many times you've missed them, by when they were created, etc.), what categories the words will come from, and more.
