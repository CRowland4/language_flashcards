# Spanish Flashcards
#### Video Demo:  https://studio.youtube.com/video/svyoubYb7s8/edit
#### Description: An app for making vocabulary flashcards.

To use, set up a MySQL server and replace the password in `database/my_connect.py` with your own. (The password shown is
not sensitive - it is only used to edit the vocabulary words on my local machine that were shown in the video.)

There are two functionalities: Add cards and Review Cards.

You can choose which categories your cards go into, or choose to drop them into a general category. You are also able to add an example sentence in the language of the word, for extra context. All of this will be saved in the database.

When choosing the Review option, you can choose quick review - which will instantly give you 10 words to practice - or you can curate your own review by choosing how the words are chosen for you (by how many times you've missed them, by when they were created, etc.), what categories the words will come from, and more.

The following categories currently exist:

1: All
2: Materials
3: Tools and Weapons
4: Outdoors
5: Body and Physical Bodily Actions
6: Clothing
7: Animals
8: People
9: Infrequently used

The "Infrequently used" category is used for words that, on advice from my Spanish instructor, are not words used in day-to-day conversation.

This project is meant to be a continual "work in progress", with things being added and edited small bits at a time as I think of them.

I'm not sure what else to say, it's a very simple-to-use project, but submit50 is insisting that this description should be longer for full credit. Please enjoy this poem, written by ChatGPT:

ACT I

In a realm of words, a scholar did dwell,
With quill in hand, his story to tell.
But alas! His tale fell short, you see,
For length requirements were not meant to be.

ACT II

With furrowed brow and troubled mind,
The scholar pondered, what could he find?
To stretch his words, to fill the space,
With substance lacking, what a disgrace!

ACT III

To thesaurus he turned, in desperate need,
For longer words he sought with speed.
But though his vocabulary grew,
His paper still remained too few.

ACT IV

In frustration, he paced the floor,
His tale incomplete, forevermore.
For though his wit was sharp and keen,
His writing fell short, like a wilted bean.

ACT V

Oh, cruel fate, to mock his plight,
To leave him stranded in the night.
For length requirements, a tyrant's decree,
Forever haunting, as far as the eye can see.

EPILOGUE

So let this be a lesson learned,
To all who to the written page have turned.
Beware the sting of shortness, beware!
Lest you find yourself in despair.
